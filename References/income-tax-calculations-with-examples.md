## Finding the Threshold Income Where Tax Becomes Payable

With the given reliefs of RM18,255.24 and the RM400 individual rebate, we need to find the income level where tax exceeds RM400.

1. Working backward from chargeable income:
   - For tax to exceed RM400, we need a chargeable income where:
     - Tax on first RM20,000 (RM150) + Tax on amount over RM20,000 at 3% > RM400
     - This means RM150 + (Chargeable income - RM20,000) × 0.03 > RM400
     - Solving: (Chargeable income - RM20,000) × 0.03 > RM250
     - Chargeable income - RM20,000 > RM8,333.33
     - Chargeable income > RM28,333.33

2. Therefore, a chargeable income of approximately RM28,334 would result in tax slightly exceeding the RM400 rebate.

3. To calculate the actual gross income:
   - Gross income = Chargeable income + Total reliefs
   - Gross income = RM28,334 + RM18,255.24
   - Gross income = RM46,589.24

## Conclusion

- With the specified tax reliefs totaling RM18,255.24 and considering the RM400 rebate:
  - At an annual income of RM24,000, you would pay no income tax
  - At an annual income of RM48,000, you would pay RM42.34 in income tax
  - At an annual income of RM60,000, you would pay RM1,004.69 in income tax
  - At an annual income of RM72,000, you would pay RM1,911.92 in income tax
  - The approximate threshold where you begin to pay income tax is RM46,589.24
